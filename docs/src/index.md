[UnfoldMakie.jl](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMakie.jl) excels in various fields:

- **Focused.** [UnfoldMakie.jl](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMakie.jl) focuses exclusively on visualizing (r)ERPs, unlike other toolboxes such as [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/), [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/), `Brainstorm`, or [MNE](http://mne.tools). This makes it easier to understand, use, and maintain the package in the future.

- **Customizable.** The majority of EEG researchers perceive the flexibility of coding as the most important feature of the EEG toolbox. Consequently, users [UnfoldMakie.jl](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMakie.jl) have great flexibility in customizing most aspects of the plots, such as colors, line styles, and axis decorations. 

- **Combining plots** The layout system for subplots in `Makie.jl` makes it easy to combine and align various plot types.
- **Flexible mapping.** With [AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](https://aog.makie.org/), it is easy to map conditions, groups, channels, or other features, to a large variety of aesthetics like linestyle, color, marker and others. It works similar to the popular R package [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

- **Flexible data input.** All functions support basic `Arrays` and tidy `DataFrames`.

- **Fast.** Julia and `Makie.jl` allows fast plotting of figures with very complex layout. As an example, it is able to plot one figure with 50 topoplots in 1.9 seconds (1.6 sec with DelaunayMesh interpolation), which is ~20 times faster, compared to [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/). Although, the Python-based [MNE](http://mne.tools) is faster by one second. For more details check [this page](https://unfoldtoolbox.github.io/UnfoldMakie.jl/dev/generated/intro/speed/)

- **Faster updating.** `Makie.jl` is incredibly fast at updating figures, which is beneficial for developing interactive tools and creating animations. [UnfoldMakie.jl](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMakie.jl) can create and save a topoplot gif file with 50 frames in 1.7 times less time than [MNE](http://mne.tools) (Table 2).

- **Interactive.** Several plots in our package have interactive features. They are supported by `Observables.jl`, which allows for fast data exchange and quick plot updating.

- **Scientific color maps.** According to our previous study [(Mikheev, 2024)](https://apertureneuro.org/article/116386-the-art-of-brainwaves-a-survey-on-event-related-potential-visualization-practices), 40% of EEG researchers are not aware of the issue of perceptually non-uniform color maps. [UnfoldMakie.jl](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMakie.jl) uses scientific color maps throughout.

- **Documented.** There is extensive documentation with many usage examples and docstrings.
