# UnfoldMakie Documentation


This is the documentation of the UnfoldMakie module for the Julia programming language. 

## About

UnfoldMakie aims to allow users to create different types of visualizations. 
These include line plots, butterfly plots, design matrices, parallel coordinate plots, ERP images, and topo plots.
Building on the [Unfold](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/unfold.jl/) and [Makie](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/) Modules, it also allows users to customize the plots through an input configuration.

As can be seen from the types of visualizations possible, these configuration options try to enable the user to create plots that are helpful in the field of computational EEG.
One such example is the ability to use a topo plot as a legend for a line plot by allowing multiple visualizations within a figure.
