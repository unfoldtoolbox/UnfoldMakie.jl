# # Styling your plot
# ## Mapping's
# everything you can put in a mapping(...) AoG group can be modified, for instance:
plot_results(results, mapping = (; linestyle = :coefname))

# ## Adding P-values
# You can provide a dataframe with columns (must): `:from`,`:to`,future versions might allow a `:pvalue` column
pvals = DataFrame(
    :from => [0.1, 0.0, -0.1],
    :to => [0.5, 0.3, 0.6],
    :pvalue => [0.01, 0.01, 0.001], # optional
    :coefname => ["(Intercept)", "conditionA", "continuousA"],
)

plot_results(results, pvalue = pvals)

# !!! note
#   If you do not give the coefname, all lines will be the same color as the first color-grouping (typically coefname), and they might overlap!
