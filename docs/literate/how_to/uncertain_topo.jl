# Representing uncertainty is one of the most difficult tasks in visualization. It is especially difficult for heatmaps and topoplots. 
# Here we will present new ways to show uncertainty for topoplots series.

# Uncertainty in EEG data usually comes from subjects and trials: 
# 1) Subjects can vary in phisological or behavioral characteristics; 
# 2) Something can change between trials (electrode connection can get worse, etc.).

# There are several measures of uncertainty. Here we will use `standard deviation` (x - mean(x) / N) and `t-values` (mean(x) / SE(x)).
# # Data input
# Data for customized topoplots:
dat, positions = TopoPlots.example_data()
vec_estimate = dat[:, 340, 1];
vec_uncert = dat[:, 340, 2];
# Data for animation:

df_toposeries, pos_toposeries =
    UnfoldMakie.example_data("bootstrap_toposeries"; noiselevel = 7);
df_toposeries = df_toposeries[df_toposeries.trial.<=15, :];
rng = MersenneTwister(1);
# This will generate DataFrame with 227 channels, 50 trials, 500 mseconds for bootstrapping.
# `noiselevel` is important for adding variability it your data.

# # Adjacent topoplot
# In this case we already have two data vectors: `vec_estimate` with mean estimates and `vec_uncert` with standard deviation.
