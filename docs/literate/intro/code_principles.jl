# # Code principles
#= Here we will write about principles which we developed through our publication.

- Code should be clear and concise
- Variables inside the code should have meaningful names
- Every function exposed to the user should have documentation that specifies all parameters, types, input and output arguments.
- Most people will not look at the defaults, so it is very important to nudge users to show important details with a picture or text.
- Function naming should be based on some theory and naming conventions.
- You should avoid functions longer 50 lines
