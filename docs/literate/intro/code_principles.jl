# # Code principles


# Here we will write about principles which we developed through our [publication](https://apertureneuro.org/article/116386-the-art-of-brainwaves-a-survey-on-event-related-potential-visualization-practices):

# - Code should be clear and concise.
# - Variables in the code should have meaningful names.
# - Every function exposed to the user should have documentation that specifies all parameters, types, and input and output arguments.
# - Most people will not look at the defaults, so it is very important to encourage users to label important details of the representation.
# - Function naming should be based on some theory and naming conventions.
# - You should avoid functions longer than 50 lines. 
# - You should avoid putting more than 5 functions in a file. 
# - You should avoid pull requests with more than 10 affected files.
