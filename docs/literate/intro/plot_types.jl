# # The Dilemma of Multidimensionality

#=
EEG â€“ multidimensional data and could be presented differently.

Possible dimensions:
- Voltage (must have)
- Time
- Number of channels (1-128)
- Spatial layout of channels
- Experimental conditions
- Trials/subjects

# # Plot types

# Each plot type can represent several dimensions. Here we represented 8 plot types.
