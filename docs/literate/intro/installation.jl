# [Installation](@id install_instruct)

# # Getting Julia

# You can install Julia by following the instructions from the [official website](https://julialang.org/). 

# ## Setup UnfoldMakie.jl

# After installing Julia, you can execute the `julia.exe`. 

# ## Generate a Project


# If you do not yet have a project you can generate one. 
# First you type `]` into the Julia console to switch from `julia` to `(@VERSION) pkg`. 
# Here you can generate a project by using the command: 

# `generate "FOLDER_PATH"`


# Note that the specific folder in which you want to generate the project does not already exist.

# ## Activate your Project

# Before you can add the necessary modules to use UnfoldMakie you have to activate your project in the `(@VERSION) pkg` environment. 
# The command is: 

# `activate "FOLDER_PATH"`

# ## Install the UnfoldMakie Module

# When your project is activated you can add the module. 
# The command is: 

# `add UnfoldMakie`


# ## Using the Project in a Pluto Notebook

# In case you want to use this generated project in a notebook (e.g. [Pluto](https://www.juliapackages.com/p/pluto) or [Jupyter](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)), you can activate this in the notebook in the following manner:


# ```julia
# begin
#    using Pkg
#    Pkg.activate("FOLDER_PATH")
#    Pkg.resolve()
# end
# ```

# Use slash `/` for the folder path.
