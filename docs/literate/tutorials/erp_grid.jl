# # ERP grid 
# **ERP grid** is a plot type for visualisation of Event-related potentials. 
# It can fully represent time, channel, and layout dimensions using lines. It can also partially represent condition dimensions.
# Lines are displayed on a grid. The location of each axis represents the location of the electrode.
# This plot type is not as popular because it is too cluttered.
